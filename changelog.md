# Pull Request: Fix DarkAdaptationRenderer LWJGL crash

## Unreleased

- Fixed the dark-adaptation viewport query crashing under LWJGL 2 by ensuring its reusable query
  buffer meets LWJGL's required capacity.
- Added a `runClient` preparation task that exposes ForgeGradle's generated MCP field and method CSV
  mappings at the location expected by legacy coremods.
- Fixed Hardcore Darkness 1.7.10 failing to transform `WorldProviderHell` in the development client
  with `Couldn't find MCP mappings`.
- Documented the generated, development-only `mcp/` directory and excluded it from version control.
